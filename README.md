# Vizzuality Coding Challenge

## Notes

- Style is done using Fela, sometimes it was left inlined.
- It has a grid loading placeholder.
- Some JSX vars could and probably should be components by themselves in a more robust project.
- For a project this size I am not sure if I had used a state management library or just react state in the main container.

## Difficulties during development

- I have not much experience with redux so it would have been simpler to use mobx, but it was an interesting experience.
- I was a bit frustrated with the linter settings. Decide to not disable it for getting an idea of vizzuality's coding style.
